At the opening of the ceremony, den leader is in the rear of the room with the Webelos Scouts. The Den Leader should blindfold all scouts and have each put his right hand on the right shoulder of the scout in front of him. The Scoutmaster for the troop Webelos are crossing into should wait on the far side of the bridge.
The Den Leader leads the Webelos to the parents who each take the hand of their son and guide him to the ceremony table. At that point, they take the blindfold off.</div>
<span class="actor">Cubmaster</span>: As a Cub Scout, you have been guided on the Cub Scout Trail with the help of many Akelas. Soon, when you become a Boy Scout, you will find that, while there are still many people willing to help, you take on more and more responsibility for blazing your own trail to Eagle. <br />
[Call out each AoL recipient name], you have been called before the Pack because you have satisfied the requirements for Cub Scouting's highest rank: The Arrow of Light. In Cub Scouts, we use three colors to remind us of the most important principles of Cub Scouting. The first color is to remind you of the lessons you learned as a Cub Scout. <span style="background-color: blue; color: white;">Blue</span> represents the spirit of Cub Scouting: the spirit of giving goodwill and doing your best. Do you promise to fulfill the Cub Scout Promise and the Cub Scout motto, Do Your Best, when you receive the Arrow of Light badge?<br />
<div class="response">
[Webelos Scouts answer, 'We do.']</div>
<span class="actor">Cubmaster</span>: This/These Webelos Scout(s) has/have faithfully promised always to keep the spirit of Cub Scouting. As their parents, do you also promise to continue to help your boy in his Scouting adventures?<br />
<div class="response">
[Parents answer, 'We do.']</div>
<span class="actor">Cubmaster</span>: The second color, <span style="background-color: red; color: white;">red</span>, represents the Scout Law. Youth and adult leaders will show you the skills you need, but it will be up to you to live up to the 12 points of the Scout Law. Daily you will be faced with decisions and, at times, the trail will seem difficult to follow. Make your choices by always remembering the Scout Law. In all you do, do you promise to be forever Trustworthy, Loyal, Helpful, Friendly, Courteous, Kind, Obedient, Cheerful, Thrifty, Brave, Clean and Reverent?<br />

<span class="actor">Cubmaster</span>: The third color, <span style="background-color: yellow; color: black;">yellow</span>, stands for the Arrow of Light. Its shaft is straight and narrow: just as is the path that you Scouts should follow throughout your life. Its tip points the way: the way to success in all that you do. It is pointing to the right: a symbol that nothing should be left undone; if it is within your power to do it, see that it is done. And lastly, this is the symbol of the seven rays of the sun, one for each day of the week; this is to remind you that every day is a new day: a day to Do Your Best in everything:<br />
<div style="margin: 0 auto; text-align: center;">
A day to honor your God and Country, to do your Good Turn,<br />
a new chance to follow the Scout Law and to remember these words: On My Honor!</div>
<span class="actor">Cubmaster</span>: This/Each boy has blazed his own trail toward the Arrow of Light award, and now the Arrow of Light will help him/them remember their promise to keep the Spirit of Cub Scouting alive. Do you promise to let its light shine forth from you, to set an example for others to follow in your footsteps, to set your eye on the Eagle and never waiver?<br />

[Webelos reply, 'We promise.']</div>
<span class="actor">Cubmaster</span>: Then I, Akela, have the distinct honor to say to you: You are now full-fledged Arrow of Light holders!<br />

<span class="actor">Cubmaster</span>: Now, a new color, <span style="background-color: green; color: white;">green</span>, will remind you that you have begun your path toward Eagle as a Boy Scout. As you stand at the the bridge into Boy Scouting, prepare yourself to no longer be known as a Webelos Scout, but now as a Boy Scout.<br />
Your may now cross the bridge that connects Cub Scouting with Boy Scouting. Your Boy Scout leader is waiting to welcome you into the troop.<br />

Each boy crosses the bridge then returns with his family to their seats.</div>
