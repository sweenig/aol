Use the default time of 2 hours or set it to whatever time you want (set in HH:MM:SS format). Then click the "Light" button. The candle will burn down targeting being pretty much completely burned down by the end of the goal time set. If/when the cubs forget to mind their conduct, you can click the "Extinguish" button, which will stop the candle from burning down and completely hide it. You can resume from there if you wish. At the end of the meeting, make a note of the time and continue burning down the candle at the next meeting.
